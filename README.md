# RandomiteOre
##Version: 1.3.0
Mod for Minecraft that adds a new ore, a nether varient of that ore, and an item to help craft it.

##About
I learned a lot through looking around at other mod's code on here, so I figured I would throw my code up as well, it's not the best in some parts, I really only code for fun most of the time. I just hope this can be helpful to someone in the future.
Feel free to use parts of this as you wish, as long as you don't outright reupload it in it's complete form and take credit for it.
It would be nice to know what people are doing with it :)

##Configuration
I've written up a page on the wiki documenting the configuration file and how to modify it, just about every aspect of this mod is run through the configuration file, allowing it to be pretty customizable.
